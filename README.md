# TensorFlow-Get-started
getting started  with Machine Learning using TensorFlow. With Linear Regression we are able to factor in all the property of an house

under one roof of a regression model from a graph plotting to determine the price

from the graph, we have the formula

y=a+bx:

y:Dependent Variable

a:y-intercept

b:slope of the graph

X: independent variable

Now as the condtions increase we have to factor in all the condition giving us the new formula for the training data as:

y = a + bX1 + b1X1 + b3X3........

When working with tensorflow, every images has axis and pixel representaion as either 2-D

or 3/4 D . the images are also represented as RGB or the Gray scale and has array of

ex. (6,6,3) and (6,6,1) respectively . The third rep the channel as RGB has three chnnels of 

255-0 and 0 or 1 for the gray scale
